	abstract = {The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) to interconnect and Internet-connect everyday people, objects, and machines poses new challenges in the design of wireless communication networks. The design of medium access control (MAC) protocols has been traditionally an intense area of research due to their high impact on the overall performance of wireless communications. The majority of research activities in this field deal with different variations of protocols somehow based on ALOHA, either with or without listen before talk, i.e., carrier sensing multiple access. These protocols operate well under low traffic loads and low number of simultaneous devices. However, they suffer from congestion as the traffic load and the number of devices increase. For this reason, unless revisited, the MAC layer can become a bottleneck for the success of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing MAC solutions for the IoT, describing current limitations and envisioned challenges for the near future. Motivated by those, we identify a family of simple algorithms based on distributed queueing (DQ), which can operate for an infinite number of devices generating any traffic load and pattern. A description of the DQ mechanism is provided and most relevant existing studies of DQ applied in different scenarios are described in this paper. In addition, we provide a novel performance evaluation of DQ when applied for the IoT. Finally, a description of the very first demo of DQ for its use in the IoT is also included in this paper.},

	abstract = {A near perfect stable random access protocol for a broadcast channel, the distributed queuing random access protocol (DQRAP), is presented and evaluated. The DQRAP protocol utilizes minislots to provide ternary channel feedback and two distributed queues to resolve contention and to schedule the transmission of messages. Modeling and simulation indicate that the DQRAP protocol, using as few as three minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. The DQRAP protocol is stable and not sensitive to propagation delay and thus offers the potential of improved performance over current protocols in satellite, metropolitan and packet radio networks.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, FSA has an efficiency bounded to 36.8\% due to contention effects, which reduces packet throughput and increases energy consumption. In this paper, we target such scenarios by presenting Low-Power Distributed Queuing (LPDQ), a highly efficient and low-power MAC protocol. LPDQ is able to self-schedule data transmissions, acting as a FSA MAC under light traffic and seamlessly converging to a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC under congestion. The paper presents the design principles and the implementation details of LPDQ using low-power commercial radio transceivers. Experiments demonstrate an efficiency close to 99\% that is independent of the number of nodes and is fair in terms of resource allocation.},

The conventional solution is to establish an interleaving factor equal to or greater than 2a+1 and to then operate 2a+1 protocol engines in parallel. Arriving packets compete in a given slot and stay with that slot till transmission is complete. The algorithm presented in this paper utilizes the usual interleaving factor of 2a+1 but after contention is resolved all packets awaiting transmission enter a common global queue.

When end devices or sensor nodes are located in very remote zones with inaccessible topography, Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) has been proposed as an appealing solution. In DtS-IoT, isolated sensor nodes can directly relay data to and from inexpensive nanosatellites (i.e., CubeSats). However, because both sensor nodes and CubeSats operate on very limited energy supply and storage, the efficient management of power-hungry communication sub-systems is essential. Thus, specific Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are needed to ensure the minimal overhead while considering DtS-IoT scalability and channel dynamics. In this work, we contribute with REserve-and-Send Sift-IoT (RESS-IoT), a scalable and energy-efficient DtS-IoT MAC protocol, combining the LoRa physical layer with a novel link scheduling approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution provides up to four times the energy savings in the satellite and up to seven times the energy savings at the sensor node on the ground with respect to state-of-the-art IoT protocols.},

Furthermore, in many sensor network applications, it is sufficient if a subset of the nodes that observe the same event report it. We show that traditional carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols for sensor networks do not handle the first constraint adequately, and do not take advantage of the second property, leading to degraded latency as the network scales in size. We present Sift, a medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks designed with the above observations in mind. We show using simulations that as the size of the sensor network scales up to 500 nodes, Sift can offer up to a 7-fold latency reduction compared to other protocols, while maintaining competitive throughput.},

	abstract = {For decades there has been a search for a multiple access protocol for a broadcast channel that would provide a performance that approached that of the ideal M/D/1 queue. This ideal performance would provide immediate access at light loads and then seamlessly move to a reservation system at high offered loads. DQRAP (distributed queueing random access protocol) provides a performance which approaches this ideal. Furthermore it is accomplished using as few as three control minislots which suggests that, aside from establishing new theoretical bounds, DQRAP will be of great practical value.DQRAP requires that channel time be divided into slots each of which consists of one data slot and m control minislots, and that each station maintain two common distributed queues. One queue is called the data transmission queue, or simply TQ, used to organize the order of data transmission, the other queue is the collision resolution queue, or simply RQ, which is used to resolve the collisions and to prevent collisions by new arrivals. The protocol includes data transmission rules, request transmission rules and queuing discipline rules. Modelling and simulation indicate that DQRAP, using as few as 3 minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. DQRAP could prove useful in packet radio, satellite, broadband cable, cellular voice, WAN, and passive optical networks.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to allow everyday objects to connect to the Internet and seamlessly interact with users and other machines. For this vital Internet connection, most current IoT devices use a personal gateway device such as a smartphone or a home WiFi access point. The necessity of configuring and maintaining these gateways presents an additional burden for both users and developers of IoT applications. Our vision for IoT connectivity is to eliminate the need for the personal gateway by developing crowdsourced low-power wide area networks (csLPWAN). Recent technologies such as RPMA, LoRa, and R-FDMA enable links to reach 15km using ISM-band transceivers, making csLPWANs an attractive option. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of csLPWANs and develop the first csLPWAN planning tool, PlanIt, which combines topography-aware RF signal analysis with demographic data to predict LPWAN coverage in specific geographic areas. Using PlanIt, we find that most cities achieve 99\% coverage by deploying a single LPWAN base station within the city. To provide better service on the csLPWAN, we propose and evaluate D-QN, a near-optimal MAC protocol to enable efficient bandwidth sharing in highly utilized networks. In the future, csLPWANs could accommodate a heterogeneous set of IoT applications, simplifying the IoT application development cycle, reducing total system cost, improving application reliability, and enhancing the user experience.},

LoRaWAN is a medium access control (MAC) layer protocol based on the traditional Aloha algorithm which reveals a great degraded throughput when a large number of devices attempt to communicate over the shared channel at the same time. Aiming at this scalability issue, we propose to introduce the distributed queueing (DQ) algorithm into the MAC protocol over the LoRa physical layer, named DQ-LoRa. The details of DQ-LoRa are provided about the frame structure and access procedure, followed by the performance evaluations on system throughput, average delay, and energy consumption. Our analytical results show that the maximum throughput of DQ-LoRa is independent of the number of devices, and the delay is insensitive to the number of random access minislots for device contending. The numerical computation shows the gain of throughput up to 2.6-fold, and the savings of energy and latency up to 48\% and 54\%, respectively, in comparing DQ-LoRa with a pure Aloha system.},

However, the conventional MAC protocol used with LoRa is classified as an Aloha-based algorithm, which leads to drastic decrease in throughput when a huge amount of end-devices try to access the network. To achieve stable and high throughput of LoRa, we propose a design to combine the distributed queueing (DQ) and in-band-full-duplex (IBFD) technologies. The usage of DQ mechanism is benefit for fast collision resolution, while the IBFD-enabled gateway helps to reduce the heavy control overhead of DQ. The designs of access procedure and frame structure are discussed in detail. The outage probability and average throughput are evaluated under imperfect self-interference cancelation. Also, a mathematical programming method is developed to optimize the spreading factor and code rate. Numerical results show that our proposal gains an extra enhancement of 1.83-fold in throughput.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, a significant amount of energy is consumed by the sensor nodes during data packet transmission and reception. An IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol is not able to completely satisfy all the requirements of wireless body sensor networks (BSNs) in a healthcare environment. Hence there is a demand for the design of a new scalable and energy saving MAC protocols. In this paper the challenging healthcare requirements are considered and based upon these requirements, an energy efficient distributed queuing random access (EE-DQRA) MAC protocol is proposed for BSN scenarios which utilizes the concept of distributed queuing for enhanced radio channel utilization. The theoretical analysis of energy efficient EE-DQRA MAC protocol is being carried out systematically considering the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 and DQ-MAC protocol. Further, EE-DQRA performance is validated with IEEE 802.15.4 system parameters using computer simulations. The effect of relative traffic load and payload length on the energy consumption, delay and throughput are also analyzed. The simulation results shows that the proposed EE-DQRA MAC with M/M/K queuing has better energy performance than the existing DQ-MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC in BSN scenarios due to collisionless transmission in the data transmission queuing (DTQ) module while keeping the control packet overhead smaller in collision resolution queuing (CRQ) module. It is also evident that EE-DQRA requires a minimum delay in comparison to IEEE802.15.4 and DQ-MAC, due to overhead minimization and M/M/K queuing utilization in DTQ system.},
