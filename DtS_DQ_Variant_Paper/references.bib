	abstract = {The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) to interconnect and Internet-connect everyday people, objects, and machines poses new challenges in the design of wireless communication networks. The design of medium access control (MAC) protocols has been traditionally an intense area of research due to their high impact on the overall performance of wireless communications. The majority of research activities in this field deal with different variations of protocols somehow based on ALOHA, either with or without listen before talk, i.e., carrier sensing multiple access. These protocols operate well under low traffic loads and low number of simultaneous devices. However, they suffer from congestion as the traffic load and the number of devices increase. For this reason, unless revisited, the MAC layer can become a bottleneck for the success of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing MAC solutions for the IoT, describing current limitations and envisioned challenges for the near future. Motivated by those, we identify a family of simple algorithms based on distributed queueing (DQ), which can operate for an infinite number of devices generating any traffic load and pattern. A description of the DQ mechanism is provided and most relevant existing studies of DQ applied in different scenarios are described in this paper. In addition, we provide a novel performance evaluation of DQ when applied for the IoT. Finally, a description of the very first demo of DQ for its use in the IoT is also included in this paper.},

	abstract = {A near perfect stable random access protocol for a broadcast channel, the distributed queuing random access protocol (DQRAP), is presented and evaluated. The DQRAP protocol utilizes minislots to provide ternary channel feedback and two distributed queues to resolve contention and to schedule the transmission of messages. Modeling and simulation indicate that the DQRAP protocol, using as few as three minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. The DQRAP protocol is stable and not sensitive to propagation delay and thus offers the potential of improved performance over current protocols in satellite, metropolitan and packet radio networks.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, FSA has an efficiency bounded to 36.8\% due to contention effects, which reduces packet throughput and increases energy consumption. In this paper, we target such scenarios by presenting Low-Power Distributed Queuing (LPDQ), a highly efficient and low-power MAC protocol. LPDQ is able to self-schedule data transmissions, acting as a FSA MAC under light traffic and seamlessly converging to a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC under congestion. The paper presents the design principles and the implementation details of LPDQ using low-power commercial radio transceivers. Experiments demonstrate an efficiency close to 99\% that is independent of the number of nodes and is fair in terms of resource allocation.},

The conventional solution is to establish an interleaving factor equal to or greater than 2a+1 and to then operate 2a+1 protocol engines in parallel. Arriving packets compete in a given slot and stay with that slot till transmission is complete. The algorithm presented in this paper utilizes the usual interleaving factor of 2a+1 but after contention is resolved all packets awaiting transmission enter a common global queue.

DQMAN is comprised of a hierarchical, dynamic, and spontaneous master-slave clustering algorithm together with an embedded tree-splitting collision resolution algorithm based on access mini-slots. The responsibility of being master entails extra functionality, and thus extra energy consumption. Therefore, this responsibility must be shared in a dynamic manner among all the stations of the network in order to ensure fairness in the system. By allowing those stations acting as master stations to avoid contention to get access to the channel, their average packet transmission delay can be effectively reduced compared to that of slave stations. Consequently, stations may be encouraged to operate in master mode regardless of the extra functions they may have to carry out. We analyze in this letter the reduced average packet transmission delay for masters.},

When end devices or sensor nodes are located in very remote zones with inaccessible topography, Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) has been proposed as an appealing solution. In DtS-IoT, isolated sensor nodes can directly relay data to and from inexpensive nanosatellites (i.e., CubeSats). However, because both sensor nodes and CubeSats operate on very limited energy supply and storage, the efficient management of power-hungry communication sub-systems is essential. Thus, specific Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are needed to ensure the minimal overhead while considering DtS-IoT scalability and channel dynamics. In this work, we contribute with REserve-and-Send Sift-IoT (RESS-IoT), a scalable and energy-efficient DtS-IoT MAC protocol, combining the LoRa physical layer with a novel link scheduling approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution provides up to four times the energy savings in the satellite and up to seven times the energy savings at the sensor node on the ground with respect to state-of-the-art IoT protocols.},

However, existent medium access control (MAC) protocols deployed in commercial satellite networks were not designed to offer scalable solutions for the increasing number of devices predicted for IoT in the near future, nor do they consider other specific IoT characteristics. In particular, CubeSats—a low-cost solution for space technology—have the potential to become a wireless access network for the IoT, if additional requirements, including simplicity and low demands in processing, storage, and energy consumption are incorporated into MAC protocol design for satellite IoT systems. Here we review MAC protocols employed or proposed for satellite systems and evaluate their performance considering the IoT scenario along with the trend of using CubeSats for IoT connectivity. Criteria include channel load, throughput, energy efficiency, and complexity. We have found that Aloha-based protocols and interference cancellation-based protocols stand out on some of the performance metrics. However, the tradeoffs among communications performance, energy consumption, and complexity require improvements in future designs, for which we identify specific challenges and open research areas for MAC protocols deployed with next low-cost nanosatellite IoT systems.},

	abstract = {The idea of providing Internet access from space has made a strong comeback in recent years. After a relatively quiet period following the setbacks suffered by the projects proposed in the ’90s, a new wave of proposals for large constellations of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to provide global broadband access emerged between 2014 and 2016. Compared to their predecessors, the main differences of these systems are: increased performance that results from the use of digital communication payloads, advanced modulation schemes, multi-beam antennas, and more sophisticated frequency reuse schemes, as well as the cost reductions from advanced manufacturing processes (such as assembly line, highly automated, and continuous testing) and reduced launch costs. This paper compares three such large LEO satellite constellations, namely SpaceX's 4425 satellites Ku-Ka-band system, OneWeb's 720 satellites Ku-Ka-band system, and Telesat's 117 satellites Ka-band system. First, we present the system architecture of each of the constellations (as described in their respective FCC filings as of September 2018), highlighting the similarities and differences amongst the three systems. Following that, we develop a statistical method to estimate the total system throughput (sellable capacity), considering both the orbital dynamics of the space-segment and the variability in performance induced by atmospheric conditions both for the user and feeder links. Given that the location and number of ground stations play a major role in determining the total system throughput, and since the characteristics of the ground segment are not described in the FCC applications, we then run an optimization procedure to minimize the total number of stations required to support the system throughput. Finally, we conclude by identifying some of the major technical challenges that the three systems will have to overcome before becoming operational.},

We present Sift, a medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks designed with the above observations in mind. We show using simulations that as the size of the sensor network scales up to 500 nodes, Sift can offer up to a 7-fold latency reduction compared to other protocols, while maintaining competitive throughput.},

The technological landscape behind the implied surge of automated interactions among humans and machines has been shaped by plugging into the Internet very low power devices that can perform monitoring and actuation operations through very cheap circuitry. The most challenging IoT scenarios include deployments of low power devices dispersed over wide geographical areas. In such scenarios, satellites will play a key role in bridging the gap towards a pervasive IoT able to easily handle disaster recovery scenarios (earthquakes, tsunamis, and flash floods, etc.), where the presence of a resilient backhauling communications infrastructure is crucial. In these scenarios, Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) connectivity is preferred as no intermediate ground gateway is required, facilitating and speeding up the deployment of wide coverage IoT infrastructure. In this work, an in-depth yet thorough survey on the state-of-the-art of DtS-IoT is presented. The available physical layer techniques specifically designed for the IoT satellite link are described, and the suitability of both the current Medium Access Control protocol and the upper layer protocols to communicate over space links will be argued. We also discuss the design of the overall satellite LEO constellation and topology to be considered in DtS-IoT networks.},

This ideal performance would provide immediate access at light loads and then seamlessly move to a reservation system at high offered loads. DQRAP (distributed queueing random access protocol) provides a performance which approaches this ideal. Furthermore it is accomplished using as few as three control minislots which suggests that, aside from establishing new theoretical bounds, DQRAP will be of great practical value.DQRAP requires that channel time be divided into slots each of which consists of one data slot and m control minislots, and that each station maintain two common distributed queues. One queue is called the data transmission queue, or simply TQ, used to organize the order of data transmission, the other queue is the collision resolution queue, or simply RQ, which is used to resolve the collisions and to prevent collisions by new arrivals. The protocol includes data transmission rules, request transmission rules and queuing discipline rules. Modelling and simulation indicate that DQRAP, using as few as 3 minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. DQRAP could prove useful in packet radio, satellite, broadband cable, cellular voice, WAN, and passive optical networks.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to bring new opportunities for improving several services for the Society, from transportation to agriculture, from smart cities to fleet management. In this framework, massive connectivity represents one of the key issues. This is especially relevant when IoT systems are expected to cover a large geographical area or a region not reached by terrestrial network connections. In such scenarios, the usage of satellites might represent a viable solution for providing wide area coverage and connectivity in a flexible and affordable manner. Our paper presents a survey on current solutions for the deployment of IoT services in remote/rural areas by exploiting satellites. Several architectures and technical solutions are analyzed, underlining their features and limitations, and real test cases are presented. It has been highlighted that low-orbit satellites offer an efficient solution to support long-range IoT services, with a good trade-off in terms of coverage and latency. Moreover, open issues, new challenges, and innovative technologies have been focused, carefully considering the perimeter that current IoT standardization framework will impose to the practical implementation of future satellite based IoT systems.},

This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cutting-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention.},

	doi = {10.1109/I2CACIS.2019.8825008},
	abstract = {LoRa is the new communication technology under the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It emphasizes on the long-range communication with the high receiving sensitivity ability which allows it to work under the noise interference or noise floor effectively. The range of communication has become the critical part on most of the IoT system, especially in Wi- Fi and Bluetooth-based IoT system. With the emergence of LoRa technology, further improvements to applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be realized. By using a single receiver in the LoRa network, it is able to handle many nodes at multiple locations within the area, unlike Wi-Fi-based system which needs to have many access points to increase the coverage area. The combination of LoRa and Wi-Fi technology reduces the cost of deployment of the IoT system. In this paper, the actual deployment of IoT system using LoRa technology with the combination of Wi-Fi technology. Besides, this paper presents the performance and the actual coverage area of the LoRa network in both the indoor and outdoor condition. For the indoor condition, a different set of LoRa parameter including Spreading Factor and Bandwidth is tested at different locations. As a result, the quality of the LoRa network does not only depend on the distance from the gateway but also the effect of path loss due to the structural element. Moreover, a single LoRa gateway located at the middle floor of the building is able to handle the LoRa end-devices at any location within the campus with Spreading Factor of 9. A better indoor coverage can be improved by adding an additional LoRa gateway in the campus. While for the outdoor condition, the maximum coverage area in the LoRa network for Spreading Factor of 12 is 330 meters with an indoor gateway deployment.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.},

By removing the dependency on ground gateways, DtS-IoT enables a direct service on the regions illuminated by the passing-by satellite. After an in-depth overview of relevant experiments and candidate technologies, we discover that specific configurations of the Long-Range (LoRa) network protocol specification are particularly appealing to realize the DtS-IoT vision. Specifically, we profit from the maximum clock drift permitted on LoRa devices to propose the sparse satellite constellations concept. This approach significantly reduces the in-orbit DtS-IoT infrastructure at the expense of latency anyway present in resource-constrained IoT networks. We then introduce a novel algorithm comprising specific heuristics to design quasi-optimal topologies for sparse IoT constellations. Obtained results show that LoRa-compatible DtS-IoT services can already be provided world-wide with 10\% and 4\% of the satellites required for a traditional dense constellation, in different configurations.},

	abstract = {In less than a decade, Cubesats have evolved from purely educational tools to a standard platform for technology demonstration and scientific instrumentation. The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components and the ongoing miniaturization of several technologies have already led to scattered instances of missions with promising scientific value. Furthermore, advantages in terms of development cost and development time with respect to larger satellites, as well as the possibility of launching several dozens of Cubesats with a single rocket launch, have brought forth the potential for radically new mission architectures consisting of very large constellations or clusters of Cubesats. These architectures promise to combine the temporal resolution of GEO missions with the spatial resolution of LEO missions, thus breaking a traditional trade-off in Earth observation mission design. This paper assesses the current capabilities of Cubesats with respect to potential employment in Earth observation missions. A thorough review of Cubesat bus technology capabilities is performed, identifying potential limitations and their implications on 17 different Earth observation payload technologies. These results are matched to an exhaustive review of scientific requirements in the field of Earth observation, assessing the possibilities of Cubesats to cope with the requirements set for each one of 21 measurement categories. Based on this review, several Earth observation measurements are identified that can potentially be compatible with the current state-of-the-art of Cubesat technology although some of them have actually never been addressed by any Cubesat mission. Simultaneously, other measurements are identified which are unlikely to be performed by Cubesats in the next few years due to insuperable constraints. Ultimately, this paper is intended to supply a box of ideas for universities to design future Cubesat missions with high scientific payoff.},

	abstract = {A solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned in such a way that shadow of the Moon falls on the Earth. The Moon׳s shadow also falls on the Earth orbiting spacecraft. In this case, the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and spacecraft is similar to that of the Sun, Moon, and Earth but this phenomenon is often referred as a lunar eclipse falling on the spacecraft. Lunar eclipse is not as regular in terms of times of occurrence, duration, and depth as the Earth shadow eclipse and number of its occurrence per orbital location per year ranges from zero to four with an average of two per year; a spacecraft may experience two to three lunar eclipses within a twenty-four hour period [2]. These lunar eclipses can cause severe spacecraft operational problems. This paper describes two lunar shadow eclipse prediction models using a projection map approach and a line of intersection method by extending the Earth shadow eclipse models described by Srivastava et al. [10], [11] for the Earth orbiting spacecraft. The attractive feature of both models is that they are much easier to implement. Both mathematical models have been simulated for two Indian low Earth orbiting spacecrafts: Oceansat-2, Saral-1, and two geostationary spacecrafts: GSAT-10, INSAT-4CR. Results obtained by the models compare well with lunar shadow model given by Escobal and Robertson [12], and high fidelity commercial software package, Systems Tool Kit (STK) of AGI.},

	abstract = {Direct-to-Satellite-IoT (DtS-IoT) is a promising approach for data transfer to/from IoT devices in remote areas where deploying terrestrial infrastructure is not appealing or feasible. In this context, Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can serve as passing-by IoT gateways to which devices can offload buffered data to. However, transmission distance and orbital dynamics, combined with highly constrained devices on the ground makes DtS-IoT a very challenging problem. In fact, existing IoT medium access control protocols, negotiations schemes, etc. need to be revised and/or extended to scale up to these challenging conditions. The intricate time-dynamic aspects of DtS-IoT networks require of adequate simulation environments to assess the expected performance of enabling technologies. To make up for the lack of such tools, we present a novel event-driven open-source end-to-end simulation tool coined FLoRaSAT. The simulator leverages Omnet++ and includes a benchmarking DtS-IoT scenario comprising 16 cross-linked LEO satellites and 1500 IoT nodes on the surface. Satellites and devices are connected using the standard LoRaWAN Low-Power Wide Area (LPWAN) protocol (Class A and B). FLoRaSAT allows the easy implementation and study of DtS-IoT radio access and core network protocols, and we take advantage of this flexibility to investigate expected network metrics and non-intuitive phenomena emerging from the resulting multi-gateway setup.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to allow everyday objects to connect to the Internet and seamlessly interact with users and other machines. For this vital Internet connection, most current IoT devices use a personal gateway device such as a smartphone or a home WiFi access point. The necessity of configuring and maintaining these gateways presents an additional burden for both users and developers of IoT applications. Our vision for IoT connectivity is to eliminate the need for the personal gateway by developing crowdsourced low-power wide area networks (csLPWAN). Recent technologies such as RPMA, LoRa, and R-FDMA enable links to reach 15km using ISM-band transceivers, making csLPWANs an attractive option. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of csLPWANs and develop the first csLPWAN planning tool, PlanIt, which combines topography-aware RF signal analysis with demographic data to predict LPWAN coverage in specific geographic areas. Using PlanIt, we find that most cities achieve 99\% coverage by deploying a single LPWAN base station within the city. To provide better service on the csLPWAN, we propose and evaluate D-QN, a near-optimal MAC protocol to enable efficient bandwidth sharing in highly utilized networks. In the future, csLPWANs could accommodate a heterogeneous set of IoT applications, simplifying the IoT application development cycle, reducing total system cost, improving application reliability, and enhancing the user experience.},

LoRaWAN is a medium access control (MAC) layer protocol based on the traditional Aloha algorithm which reveals a great degraded throughput when a large number of devices attempt to communicate over the shared channel at the same time. Aiming at this scalability issue, we propose to introduce the distributed queueing (DQ) algorithm into the MAC protocol over the LoRa physical layer, named DQ-LoRa. The details of DQ-LoRa are provided about the frame structure and access procedure, followed by the performance evaluations on system throughput, average delay, and energy consumption. Our analytical results show that the maximum throughput of DQ-LoRa is independent of the number of devices, and the delay is insensitive to the number of random access minislots for device contending. The numerical computation shows the gain of throughput up to 2.6-fold, and the savings of energy and latency up to 48\% and 54\%, respectively, in comparing DQ-LoRa with a pure Aloha system.},

However, the conventional MAC protocol used with LoRa is classified as an Aloha-based algorithm, which leads to drastic decrease in throughput when a huge amount of end-devices try to access the network. To achieve stable and high throughput of LoRa, we propose a design to combine the distributed queueing (DQ) and in-band-full-duplex (IBFD) technologies. The usage of DQ mechanism is benefit for fast collision resolution, while the IBFD-enabled gateway helps to reduce the heavy control overhead of DQ. The designs of access procedure and frame structure are discussed in detail. The outage probability and average throughput are evaluated under imperfect self-interference cancelation. Also, a mathematical programming method is developed to optimize the spreading factor and code rate. Numerical results show that our proposal gains an extra enhancement of 1.83-fold in throughput.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, a significant amount of energy is consumed by the sensor nodes during data packet transmission and reception. An IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol is not able to completely satisfy all the requirements of wireless body sensor networks (BSNs) in a healthcare environment. Hence there is a demand for the design of a new scalable and energy saving MAC protocols. In this paper the challenging healthcare requirements are considered and based upon these requirements, an energy efficient distributed queuing random access (EE-DQRA) MAC protocol is proposed for BSN scenarios which utilizes the concept of distributed queuing for enhanced radio channel utilization. The theoretical analysis of energy efficient EE-DQRA MAC protocol is being carried out systematically considering the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 and DQ-MAC protocol. Further, EE-DQRA performance is validated with IEEE 802.15.4 system parameters using computer simulations. The effect of relative traffic load and payload length on the energy consumption, delay and throughput are also analyzed. The simulation results shows that the proposed EE-DQRA MAC with M/M/K queuing has better energy performance than the existing DQ-MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC in BSN scenarios due to collisionless transmission in the data transmission queuing (DTQ) module while keeping the control packet overhead smaller in collision resolution queuing (CRQ) module. It is also evident that EE-DQRA requires a minimum delay in comparison to IEEE802.15.4 and DQ-MAC, due to overhead minimization and M/M/K queuing utilization in DTQ system.},

The protocol is a free random access protocol when the traffic load is light, and switches smoothly and automatically to a reservation protocol when traffic load becomes heavier. It is based on distributed queues and a collision resolution algorithm. Moreover, a physical receiver structure is proposed and analyzed in order to preserve the robustness of the protocol in a wireless link.

To support massive machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with delay constraints in cellular networks, we design an efficient random access and data transmission system known as distributed queueing random access-multiple-input multiple-output (DQRA-MIMO) data transmission system. This system has the advantages of both efficient collision resolution of DQRA protocol and the efficient data transmission of MIMO technology. To obtain higher throughput under delay constraint and limited time-frequency resources, we match the ability of collision resolution with the capability of MIMO transmission by optimally configuring system parameters. The closed-form expression of throughput is derived, which is a function of the total user equipments' traffic arrival rate, average packet number of each arrival, number of base station antennas, and number of access request (AR) slots. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the throughput to obtain the optimal number of AR slots given a certain delay constraint for M2M traffic. Numerical and simulation results reveal that, for a given requirement of average delay, the proposed optimized DQRA-MIMO system, which dynamically adjusts time-frequency resource division to maximize throughput, can provide a higher throughput than that of a baseline approach.},

In this paper, we propose and study an efficient demand assignment channel access protocol, which we call distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA). The protocol can be used for a wide range of applications and geographic distances. Mobiles need to send requests to the base station only for packets that arrive to an empty buffer. For packets that arrive to a non-empty buffer transmission requests are placed collision-free by piggybacking the requests with packet transmissions. The simulation results show that even with the "worst possible" traffic characteristics, the delay-throughput performance of DQRUMA is close to the best possible with any access protocol. In addition, explicit slot-by-slot announcement of the "transmit permissions" gives the base station a lot of control over the order in which mobiles transmit their packets.},

In this article the DQCA protocol operation is thoroughly described, and its algorithm rules are given. Furthermore, an enhanced cross-layer scheduling mechanism is also proposed for inclusion in the protocol procedure. This mechanism employs a virtual priority function to reschedule transmissions according to a cross-layer design. Two possible configurations are described in this article by including a PHY-MAC dialog involving channel stale information and the waiting time of the packets in the system, offering a trade-off between throughput maximization and fairness. The performance in terms of throughput and mean delay of DQCA and the two cross-layer schemes has been evaluated through simulations, and a significant enhancement over legacy IEEE 802.11 operation is achieved. The obtained results emphasize the advantages of the proposed schemes and the importance of cross-layer design in wireless communication systems.},

	abstract = {Wireless body sensor networks (BSNs) in healthcare systems operate under conflicting requirements. These are the maintenance of the desired reliability and message latency of data transmissions, while simultaneously maximizing battery lifetime of individual body sensors. In doing so, the characteristics of the entire system, including physical, medium access control (MAC), and application layers have to be considered. The aim of this paper is to develop a new MAC model for BSNs to fulfill all these specific rigorous requirements under realistic medical settings. For that purpose, a novel cross-layer fuzzy-rule scheduling algorithm and energy-aware radio activation policies are introduced. The main idea is to integrate a fuzzy-logic system in each body sensor to deal with multiple cross-layer input variables of diverse nature in an independent manner. By being autonomously aware of their current condition, body sensors are able to demand a "collision-free" time slot, whenever they consider it strictly required (e.g. high system packet delay or low body sensor residual battery lifetime). Similarly, they may refuse to transmit, if there is a bad channel link, thus permitting another body sensor to do so. This results in improving the system overall performance. The proposed MAC model is evaluated by computer simulations in terms of quality of service and energy consumption under specific healthcare scenarios.},
