abstract = {Vulnerable road users (VRUs, i.e. cyclists and pedestrians) will play an important role in future traffic. To avoid accidents and achieve a highly efficient traffic flow, it is important to detect VRUs and to predict their intentions. In this article a holistic approach for detecting intentions of VRUs by cooperative methods is presented. The intention detection consists of basic movement primitive prediction, e.g. standing, moving, turning, and a forecast of the future trajectory. Vehicles equipped with sensors, data processing systems and communication abilities, referred to as intelligent vehicles, acquire and maintain a local model of their surrounding traffic environment, e.g. crossing cyclists. Heterogeneous, open sets of agents (cooperating and interacting vehicles, infrastructure, e.g. cameras and laser scanners, and VRUs equipped with smart devices and body-worn sensors) exchange information forming a multi-modal sensor system with the goal to reliably and robustly detect VRUs and their intentions under consideration of real time requirements and uncertainties. The resulting model allows to extend the perceptual horizon of the individual agent beyond their own sensory capabilities, enabling a longer forecast horizon. Concealments, implausibilities and inconsistencies are resolved by the collective intelligence of cooperating agents. Novel techniques of signal processing and modelling in combination with analytical and learning based approaches of pattern and activity recognition are used for detection, as well as intention prediction of VRUs. Cooperation, by means of probabilistic sensor and knowledge fusion, takes place on the level of perception and intention recognition. Based on the requirements of the cooperative approach for the communication a new strategy for an ad hoc network is proposed.},

abstract = {Cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to accommodate growing mobility demands with lower environmental impact and increased road safety. In urban scenarios, C-ITS will eventually permit the road infrastructure to meet these goals by monitoring, supporting and orchestrating CAVs' movements. For this purpose, V2X communications to concurrently guide CAVs at signalized intersections, consider platoons and inform about presence of non-cooperative road users are needed, among others. The design of these V2X communications is not trivial as it has to take into account application requirements as well as key aspects like backward compatibility and interoperability in already deployed scenarios. This paper will describe the V2X solutions adopted by the EU funded project MAVEN in this regard. By smartly extending or profiling current and new standard message sets, these solutions are suitable for real-road experiments and provide potential for future industrial adoption.},

These V2P systems serve different purposes (safety or convenience) and cater to different Vulnerable Road User (VRU) groups. Also, these V2P systems employ different communication technologies, and use different mechanisms to interact with the users. An effective V2P system also needs to consider varying characteristics of different VRUs. These various elements may be considered as design parameters of the V2P system. In this paper, we discuss such elements and propose a design framework for the V2P system based on them. We also provide an extensive survey of existing V2P efforts for safety and convenience applications and their design considerations. We perform a case study that compares the different approaches of V2P safety system for different VRU groups under different pre-crash scenarios.

CP enables vehicles to detect objects (e.g. non-connected vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles, etc.) beyond their local sensing capabilities. ETSI is currently developing the European standards for collective perception or cooperative sensing. This includes defining which information should be exchanged about the detected objects, and how often it should be exchanged. To this aim, different CP generation rules for collective perception are currently under analysis, and this paper presents an in-depth analysis of their performance and efficiency. The conducted analysis highlights the existing tradeoffs between performance (capacity to detect surrounding objects) and efficiency (redundant detection and transmission of the same detected objects). It also demonstrates the need to design advanced policies that dynamically control the redundancy on the wireless channel while ensuring the capacity to reliably detect the driving environment.},

abstract = {Cooperation between vehicles and/or with static elements of the road infrastructure enables a wide number of applications and services, such as traffic monitoring and prediction, localization and mapping, or novel safety approaches for vulnerable road users. For instance, relying on on-board sensors, on conventional navigation systems, and on V2X wireless connectivity, vehicles can represent geo-tagged measurements (e.g., LiDAR) in the form of local occupancy grid maps accounting for the presence of obstacles. The latter maps can be subsequently shared, either directly (e.g., with other fellow vehicles around) or via a centralized entity (e.g., edge cloud...). Through cooperative fusion, equipped vehicles thus contribute to elaborate a global view of the physical environment.In this paper, we first describe a flexible end-to-end system simulator that can evaluate such cooperative mapping strategies in complex road driving environments. The overall simulation flow spans from sensor and V2X connectivity abstractions up to fusion algorithms running at the application level. We then present a few illustrating simulation results in a smart intersection scenario, confirming the importance of V2X-aided cooperation to enhance the physical perception of standalone vehicles in terms of both coverage and detection performances.},

Besides the message format, very important design aspects are the generation rules governing when to generate a message and which data to include.

This paper contributes a set of generation rules for the Collective Perception Service that provides a trade-off between these two factors. Their effectiveness is detailed in an extensive simulation study. Depending on specific radio channel and Decentralized Congestion Control settings, the simulations also reveal co-existence challenges with other services and messages disseminated on the same channel, e.g., the legacy Cooperative Awareness Message. The latter findings are thereby generalized as they apply to any additional message that needs to be disseminated along with the legacy Vehicle-to-X messages.},

abstract = {Information freshness is a status update timeliness indicator of utmost importance to several real-time applications, such as connected and autonomous driving. The Ageof-Information (AoI) metric is widely considered as useful to quantify the information freshness of delivered messages to the involved entities. Recently, the advent of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) promises several performance benefits for Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications, emphasizing on the experienced End-to-End (E2E) message delay. In this paper, we argue that, when it comes to safety-critical use cases, such as the one of Vulnerable Road User (VRU), additional metrics can be more insightful to evaluate and address scalability issues in dense urban environments. In particular, the impact of the packet inter-arrival time on the timeliness of VRU messages arriving at nearby vehicles can be directly assessed by exploiting the AoI metric. For that purpose, assuming a MEC-enabled multi-VRU system setting, we model the AoI and, by means of a performance comparison to the state-of-the-art network architecture based on numerical evaluations, we provide evidence of the information freshness and system scalability enhancements offered by MEC infrastructure deployment for different system parameter settings involving a large number of connected entities.},

It enables vehicles to exchange information about locally perceived objects via Collective Perception Messages, improving situational awareness and allowing perception of obstructed traffic participants. However, the CPS distinguishes vehicles and person-type objects when generating messages because of their difference in movement patterns and dynamics. This paper analyzes the inclusion rules for person-type objects in a large-scale simulation study, showing that the CPS can significantly improve awareness of persons with little additional channel resource usage.

As the name suggests, pedestrian zones are crowded by pedestrian having highest priority. Vehicles in such zones should take special care regarding the safety of the people. Unlimited situations can occur from the pedestrians. Hence, it becomes crucial to test such vehicles before deploying in real-world to ensure safety of the people and the environment. Therefore, there is a need to have a realistic behaviors of pedestrians in simulation for critical testing of autonomous vehicles. The major novelty in this paper is the generation of virtual pedestrians which avoid obstacles realistically and to provide a platform for accurate and easy testing of autonomous vehicles in pedestrian zones. These virtual pedestrians avoid all kinds of obstacles based on self-awareness while progressing towards the goal. Main feature of these pedestrians are based on direction and speed heuristics. The goal is to have minimum number of parameters to generate test scenarios with realistic behaving pedestrians for autonomous systems. A thorough experimentation is done to validate the system. In the final experiment, a real-world scene is recreated from the simulation and the results are compared. It is seen visually that both the trajectories from the simulation and real-world highly resemble to each other. By slightly tweaking the parameters, one can generate different test scenario.},

abstract = {Sensor data sharing enables vehicles to exchange locally perceived sensor data among each other and with the roadside infrastructure to increase their environmental awareness. It is commonly regarded as a next-generation vehicular communication service beyond the exchange of highly aggregated messages in the first generation. The approach is being considered in the European standardization process, where it relies on the exchange of locally detected objects representing anything safety-relevant, such as other vehicles or pedestrians, in periodically broadcasted messages to vehicles in direct communication range. Objects filtering methods for inclusion in a message are necessary to avoid overloading a channel and provoking unnecessary data processing. Initial studies provided in a pre-standardization report about sensor data sharing elaborated a first set of rules to filter objects based on their characteristics, such as their dynamics or type. However, these rules still lack the consideration of information received by other stations to operate. Specifically, to address the problem of information redundancy, several rules have been proposed, but their performance has not been evaluated yet comprehensively. In the present work, the rules are further analyzed, assessed, and compared. Functional and operational requirements are investigated. A performance evaluation is realized by discrete-event simulations in a scenario for a representative city with realistic vehicle densities and mobility patterns. A score and other redundancy-level metrics are elaborated to ease the evaluation and comparison of the filtering rules. Finally, improvements and future works to the filtering methods are proposed.},

The first model is based on the stereo camera system detections only, whereas the second model cooperatively combines the camera based detections with velocity and yaw rate data provided by the smart device. Our aim is to overcome limitations of tracking approaches based on single data sources. We show in numerical evaluations on scenes where cyclists are starting or turning right that the cooperation leads to an improvement in both the ability to keep track of a cyclist and the accuracy of the track particularly when it comes to occlusions in the visual system. We, therefore, contribute to the safety of vulnerable road users in future traffic.},

   abstract = {In the face of cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS) advancements, the inclusion of vulnerable road users (VRU), i.e., pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, has just recently become a part of the discussion. Including VRU in C-ITS presents new challenges, most notably the trade-off between the increase in VRU safety and the aggravation in channel congestion resulting from VRU-generated messages. However, previous studies mainly focus on network-related metrics without giving much consideration to VRU safety-related metrics. In this context, we evaluated such a trade-off with a study of motion-based message generation rules for VRU transmissions. The rules were analyzed using theoretical and simulation-based evaluations. In addition to studying the message generation rules using channel load metrics, such as channel busy ratio (CBR) and packet delivery ratio (PDR), we introduced a new metric: the VRU Awareness Probability (VAP). VAP uses the exchange of messages from active VRU to measure the probability of VRU detection by nearby vehicles. Results show that fixed message-filtering mechanisms reduce the overall channel load, but they could negatively impact VRU detection. We established the importance of quantifying the VRU awareness and its inclusion in C-ITS analysis because of its direct impact on VRU safety. We also discussed approaches that include VRU context and dynamism to improve the definition of message generation rules.},

   abstract = {© 2020 IEEE. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in researching and developing vehicular networking protocols and safety applications that consider the inclusion of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) in their design. In this work, we present a methodology that enables the inclusion of connected VRU in the well-known VEINS framework. We describe the main problems found during the integration of VRU and the necessary fixes required at the time of launching the simulation environment. The integration contributes to better understand the behavior of both connected vehicles and connected VRU in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems. The methodology has been tested with vehicular scenarios at intersections using DSRC in both vehicles and VRU, but it is also compatible with other technologies (e.g., vehicular networking supported by 5G and heterogeneous networking architectures), facilitating the connectivity from the VRU. Furthermore, with the VRU integration in the VEINS framework, it is possible to exploit the benefits of bidirectional simulations to gather traffic data, build communications networks and protocols that consider VRU, and decide over traffic dynamics at both vehicles and VRU. The tool is publicly available to the research community and continues under development.},
