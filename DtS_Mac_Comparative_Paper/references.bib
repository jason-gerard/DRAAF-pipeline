	abstract = {The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) to interconnect and Internet-connect everyday people, objects, and machines poses new challenges in the design of wireless communication networks. The design of medium access control (MAC) protocols has been traditionally an intense area of research due to their high impact on the overall performance of wireless communications. The majority of research activities in this field deal with different variations of protocols somehow based on ALOHA, either with or without listen before talk, i.e., carrier sensing multiple access. These protocols operate well under low traffic loads and low number of simultaneous devices. However, they suffer from congestion as the traffic load and the number of devices increase. For this reason, unless revisited, the MAC layer can become a bottleneck for the success of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing MAC solutions for the IoT, describing current limitations and envisioned challenges for the near future. Motivated by those, we identify a family of simple algorithms based on distributed queueing (DQ), which can operate for an infinite number of devices generating any traffic load and pattern. A description of the DQ mechanism is provided and most relevant existing studies of DQ applied in different scenarios are described in this paper. In addition, we provide a novel performance evaluation of DQ when applied for the IoT. Finally, a description of the very first demo of DQ for its use in the IoT is also included in this paper.},

	abstract = {A near perfect stable random access protocol for a broadcast channel, the distributed queuing random access protocol (DQRAP), is presented and evaluated. The DQRAP protocol utilizes minislots to provide ternary channel feedback and two distributed queues to resolve contention and to schedule the transmission of messages. Modeling and simulation indicate that the DQRAP protocol, using as few as three minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. The DQRAP protocol is stable and not sensitive to propagation delay and thus offers the potential of improved performance over current protocols in satellite, metropolitan and packet radio networks.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling unprecedented applications based on the transport of small data volumes to and from constrained devices. When end devices or sensor nodes are located in very remote zones with inaccessible topography, Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) has been proposed as an appealing solution. In DtS-IoT, isolated sensor nodes can directly relay data to and from inexpensive nanosatellites (i.e., CubeSats). However, because both sensor nodes and CubeSats operate on very limited energy supply and storage, the efficient management of power-hungry communication sub-systems is essential. Thus, specific Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are needed to ensure the minimal overhead while considering DtS-IoT scalability and channel dynamics. In this work, we contribute with REserve-and-Send Sift-IoT (RESS-IoT), a scalable and energy-efficient DtS-IoT MAC protocol, combining the LoRa physical layer with a novel link scheduling approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution provides up to four times the energy savings in the satellite and up to seven times the energy savings at the sensor node on the ground with respect to state-of-the-art IoT protocols.},

	abstract = {Extending the internet of things (IoT) networks to remote areas under extreme conditions or for serving sometimes unpredictable mobile applications has increased the need for satellite technology to provide effective connectivity. However, existent medium access control (MAC) protocols deployed in commercial satellite networks were not designed to offer scalable solutions for the increasing number of devices predicted for IoT in the near future, nor do they consider other specific IoT characteristics. In particular, CubeSats—a low-cost solution for space technology—have the potential to become a wireless access network for the IoT, if additional requirements, including simplicity and low demands in processing, storage, and energy consumption are incorporated into MAC protocol design for satellite IoT systems. Here we review MAC protocols employed or proposed for satellite systems and evaluate their performance considering the IoT scenario along with the trend of using CubeSats for IoT connectivity. Criteria include channel load, throughput, energy efficiency, and complexity. We have found that Aloha-based protocols and interference cancellation-based protocols stand out on some of the performance metrics. However, the tradeoffs among communications performance, energy consumption, and complexity require improvements in future designs, for which we identify specific challenges and open research areas for MAC protocols deployed with next low-cost nanosatellite IoT systems.},

In this article, we describe a field-tested communication approach combining CubeSat platforms and delay-tolerant networking (DTN) solutions to provide asynchronous connectivity to populations and regions that are underserved by the Internet. The resulting class of networks is known as ring road networks (RRNs), a networking approach that is built on technology developed for the construction of a solar system Internet. The necessary self-sufficiency of DTN nodes enables network access to be deployed incrementally at low cost, supporting communities that cannot be profitably served by Internet satellite constellations. We present the RRN architecture and evaluate the expected performance by means of simulations. Based on the latter, we discuss µD3TN: a lightweight and open source DTN protocol stack for RRNs and other DTN classes. µD3TN has been flight-tested in ESA's OPS-SAT in low Earth orbit during December 2020 and May 2021. This work discusses the experiment results as we validated the RRN approach in concrete application use cases. The reported outcomes motivate a new application domain.},

	abstract = {The idea of providing Internet access from space has made a strong comeback in recent years. After a relatively quiet period following the setbacks suffered by the projects proposed in the ’90s, a new wave of proposals for large constellations of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to provide global broadband access emerged between 2014 and 2016. Compared to their predecessors, the main differences of these systems are: increased performance that results from the use of digital communication payloads, advanced modulation schemes, multi-beam antennas, and more sophisticated frequency reuse schemes, as well as the cost reductions from advanced manufacturing processes (such as assembly line, highly automated, and continuous testing) and reduced launch costs. This paper compares three such large LEO satellite constellations, namely SpaceX's 4425 satellites Ku-Ka-band system, OneWeb's 720 satellites Ku-Ka-band system, and Telesat's 117 satellites Ka-band system. First, we present the system architecture of each of the constellations (as described in their respective FCC filings as of September 2018), highlighting the similarities and differences amongst the three systems. Following that, we develop a statistical method to estimate the total system throughput (sellable capacity), considering both the orbital dynamics of the space-segment and the variability in performance induced by atmospheric conditions both for the user and feeder links. Given that the location and number of ground stations play a major role in determining the total system throughput, and since the characteristics of the ground segment are not described in the FCC applications, we then run an optimization procedure to minimize the total number of stations required to support the system throughput. Finally, we conclude by identifying some of the major technical challenges that the three systems will have to overcome before becoming operational.},

We show that traditional carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols for sensor networks do not handle the first constraint adequately, and do not take advantage of the second property, leading to degraded latency as the network scales in size. We present Sift, a medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks designed with the above observations in mind. We show using simulations that as the size of the sensor network scales up to 500 nodes, Sift can offer up to a 7-fold latency reduction compared to other protocols, while maintaining competitive throughput.},

The technological landscape behind the implied surge of automated interactions among humans and machines has been shaped by plugging into the Internet very low power devices that can perform monitoring and actuation operations through very cheap circuitry. The most challenging IoT scenarios include deployments of low power devices dispersed over wide geographical areas. In such scenarios, satellites will play a key role in bridging the gap towards a pervasive IoT able to easily handle disaster recovery scenarios (earthquakes, tsunamis, and flash floods, etc.), where the presence of a resilient backhauling communications infrastructure is crucial. In these scenarios, Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) connectivity is preferred as no intermediate ground gateway is required, facilitating and speeding up the deployment of wide coverage IoT infrastructure. In this work, an in-depth yet thorough survey on the state-of-the-art of DtS-IoT is presented. The available physical layer techniques specifically designed for the IoT satellite link are described, and the suitability of both the current Medium Access Control protocol and the upper layer protocols to communicate over space links will be argued. We also discuss the design of the overall satellite LEO constellation and topology to be considered in DtS-IoT networks.},

	abstract = {For decades there has been a search for a multiple access protocol for a broadcast channel that would provide a performance that approached that of the ideal M/D/1 queue. This ideal performance would provide immediate access at light loads and then seamlessly move to a reservation system at high offered loads. DQRAP (distributed queueing random access protocol) provides a performance which approaches this ideal. Furthermore it is accomplished using as few as three control minislots which suggests that, aside from establishing new theoretical bounds, DQRAP will be of great practical value.DQRAP requires that channel time be divided into slots each of which consists of one data slot and m control minislots, and that each station maintain two common distributed queues. One queue is called the data transmission queue, or simply TQ, used to organize the order of data transmission, the other queue is the collision resolution queue, or simply RQ, which is used to resolve the collisions and to prevent collisions by new arrivals. The protocol includes data transmission rules, request transmission rules and queuing discipline rules. Modelling and simulation indicate that DQRAP, using as few as 3 minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. DQRAP could prove useful in packet radio, satellite, broadband cable, cellular voice, WAN, and passive optical networks.},

This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cutting-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention.},

	abstract = {LoRa is the new communication technology under the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It emphasizes on the long-range communication with the high receiving sensitivity ability which allows it to work under the noise interference or noise floor effectively. The range of communication has become the critical part on most of the IoT system, especially in Wi- Fi and Bluetooth-based IoT system. With the emergence of LoRa technology, further improvements to applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be realized. By using a single receiver in the LoRa network, it is able to handle many nodes at multiple locations within the area, unlike Wi-Fi-based system which needs to have many access points to increase the coverage area. The combination of LoRa and Wi-Fi technology reduces the cost of deployment of the IoT system. In this paper, the actual deployment of IoT system using LoRa technology with the combination of Wi-Fi technology. Besides, this paper presents the performance and the actual coverage area of the LoRa network in both the indoor and outdoor condition. For the indoor condition, a different set of LoRa parameter including Spreading Factor and Bandwidth is tested at different locations. As a result, the quality of the LoRa network does not only depend on the distance from the gateway but also the effect of path loss due to the structural element. Moreover, a single LoRa gateway located at the middle floor of the building is able to handle the LoRa end-devices at any location within the campus with Spreading Factor of 9. A better indoor coverage can be improved by adding an additional LoRa gateway in the campus. While for the outdoor condition, the maximum coverage area in the LoRa network for Spreading Factor of 12 is 330 meters with an indoor gateway deployment.},

	abstract = {The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and social patterns. Most industries have moved towards automation, and human intervention has decreased, which has led to a revolution in industries, named the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including environmental monitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection. IoT devices and applications are used to process extracted data from WSN devices and transmit them to remote locations. This systematic literature review offers a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, finds research gaps, and recommends future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i) What are the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What are the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0? (iv) What are the major types of network intruders in WSN and IoT systems? (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT? (vi) What are the significant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the limitations and research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses on research solutions and new techniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014 until 2021. This paper covers several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security needs, from the deployment stage to the classification of the network, the difficulties, challenges, and future directions.},

This paper analyzes IoT adoption by organizations, and identifies IoT benefits and risks. A Big, Open, Linked Data (BOLD) categorization of the expected benefits and risks of IoT is made by conducting a comprehensive literature study. In-depth case studies in the field of asset management were then executed to examine the actual experienced, real world benefits and risks. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between organization and technology. The results confirm the duality that gaining the benefits of IoT in asset management produces unexpected social changes that lead to structural transformation of the organization. IoT can provide organizations with many benefits, after having dealt with unexpected risks and making the necessary organizational changes. There is a need to introduce changes to the organization, processes and systems, to develop capabilities and ensure that IoT fits the organization’s purposes.},

Taking the perspective of an IoT solution provider in the industrial context, we evaluate the framework with five such solution providers and apply the value levers for an initial value quantification.

	abstract = {The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.},

Both architectures involve multiple CubeSats separated from each other to gather spatially and temporally distributed data. The first is a combined plasma impedance probe/DC probe system on two satellites, separated by a tether. The second is two separate CubeSats that perform GPS scintillation measurements. In addition to the common bus structure, unique design traits (such as tethered gravity gradient control) and extensive hardware and software prototyping are discussed in the paper.},

By removing the dependency on ground gateways, DtS-IoT enables a direct service on the regions illuminated by the passing-by satellite. After an in-depth overview of relevant experiments and candidate technologies, we discover that specific configurations of the Long-Range (LoRa) network protocol specification are particularly appealing to realize the DtS-IoT vision. Specifically, we profit from the maximum clock drift permitted on LoRa devices to propose the sparse satellite constellations concept. This approach significantly reduces the in-orbit DtS-IoT infrastructure at the expense of latency anyway present in resource-constrained IoT networks. We then introduce a novel algorithm comprising specific heuristics to design quasi-optimal topologies for sparse IoT constellations. Obtained results show that LoRa-compatible DtS-IoT services can already be provided world-wide with 10\% and 4\% of the satellites required for a traditional dense constellation, in different configurations.},

DtS-IoT does not require a ground infrastructure, because the devices are directly connected to low earth orbit satellites acting as orbiting gateways. The key idea of sparse constellations is to significantly reduce the number of in-orbit DtS-IoT satellites by a proper dimensioning of the delivery delay anyway present in resource-constrained IoT services and an optimal positioning of the orbiting gateways. First, we analyze long-range modulation (LoRa)/LoRaWAN and narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) standards and derive realistic constraints on the maximum gap time between two consecutive passing-by satellites. Then, we introduce and optimize an algorithm to design quasi-optimal topologies for sparse IoT constellations. Finally, we apply our design to both global and regional coverage and we analyze the tradeoff between latency, number of orbit planes, and total number of satellites. Results show that sparse constellations can provide world-wide IoT coverage with only 12.5 and 22.5\% of the satellites required by traditional dense constellations considering 3 and 2-h gaps. Also, we show that region-specific coverage of Africa and Europe can be achieved with only four and three satellites for LoRa/LoRaWAN and NB-IoT, respectively.},

	abstract = {In less than a decade, Cubesats have evolved from purely educational tools to a standard platform for technology demonstration and scientific instrumentation. The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components and the ongoing miniaturization of several technologies have already led to scattered instances of missions with promising scientific value. Furthermore, advantages in terms of development cost and development time with respect to larger satellites, as well as the possibility of launching several dozens of Cubesats with a single rocket launch, have brought forth the potential for radically new mission architectures consisting of very large constellations or clusters of Cubesats. These architectures promise to combine the temporal resolution of GEO missions with the spatial resolution of LEO missions, thus breaking a traditional trade-off in Earth observation mission design. This paper assesses the current capabilities of Cubesats with respect to potential employment in Earth observation missions. A thorough review of Cubesat bus technology capabilities is performed, identifying potential limitations and their implications on 17 different Earth observation payload technologies. These results are matched to an exhaustive review of scientific requirements in the field of Earth observation, assessing the possibilities of Cubesats to cope with the requirements set for each one of 21 measurement categories. Based on this review, several Earth observation measurements are identified that can potentially be compatible with the current state-of-the-art of Cubesat technology although some of them have actually never been addressed by any Cubesat mission. Simultaneously, other measurements are identified which are unlikely to be performed by Cubesats in the next few years due to insuperable constraints. Ultimately, this paper is intended to supply a box of ideas for universities to design future Cubesat missions with high scientific payoff.},

	abstract = {A solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned in such a way that shadow of the Moon falls on the Earth. The Moon׳s shadow also falls on the Earth orbiting spacecraft. In this case, the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and spacecraft is similar to that of the Sun, Moon, and Earth but this phenomenon is often referred as a lunar eclipse falling on the spacecraft. Lunar eclipse is not as regular in terms of times of occurrence, duration, and depth as the Earth shadow eclipse and number of its occurrence per orbital location per year ranges from zero to four with an average of two per year; a spacecraft may experience two to three lunar eclipses within a twenty-four hour period [2]. These lunar eclipses can cause severe spacecraft operational problems. This paper describes two lunar shadow eclipse prediction models using a projection map approach and a line of intersection method by extending the Earth shadow eclipse models described by Srivastava et al. [10], [11] for the Earth orbiting spacecraft. The attractive feature of both models is that they are much easier to implement. Both mathematical models have been simulated for two Indian low Earth orbiting spacecrafts: Oceansat-2, Saral-1, and two geostationary spacecrafts: GSAT-10, INSAT-4CR. Results obtained by the models compare well with lunar shadow model given by Escobal and Robertson [12], and high fidelity commercial software package, Systems Tool Kit (STK) of AGI.},

In this context, Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can serve as passing-by IoT gateways to which devices can offload buffered data to. However, transmission distance and orbital dynamics, combined with highly constrained devices on the ground makes DtS-IoT a very challenging problem. In fact, existing IoT medium access control protocols, negotiations schemes, etc. need to be revised and/or extended to scale up to these challenging conditions. The intricate time-dynamic aspects of DtS-IoT networks require of adequate simulation environments to assess the expected performance of enabling technologies. To make up for the lack of such tools, we present a novel event-driven open-source end-to-end simulation tool coined FLoRaSAT. The simulator leverages Omnet++ and includes a benchmarking DtS-IoT scenario comprising 16 cross-linked LEO satellites and 1500 IoT nodes on the surface. Satellites and devices are connected using the standard LoRaWAN Low-Power Wide Area (LPWAN) protocol (Class A and B). FLoRaSAT allows the easy implementation and study of DtS-IoT radio access and core network protocols, and we take advantage of this flexibility to investigate expected network metrics and non-intuitive phenomena emerging from the resulting multi-gateway setup.},

The details of DQ-LoRa are provided about the frame structure and access procedure, followed by the performance evaluations on system throughput, average delay, and energy consumption. Our analytical results show that the maximum throughput of DQ-LoRa is independent of the number of devices, and the delay is insensitive to the number of random access minislots for device contending. The numerical computation shows the gain of throughput up to 2.6-fold, and the savings of energy and latency up to 48\% and 54\%, respectively, in comparing DQ-LoRa with a pure Aloha system.},

Abstract: The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) greatly extends the coverage area that human being is able to perceive, access, and even control. By connecting various “Things” to the Internet, the IoT makes it possible to measure and manage the physical world as needed. As one of the most widely adopted Low Power Wide Area network technologies, the Long-Range-Radio (LoRa) has the features of long range, low power, and robustness, and thus plays an important role in building IoT applications where IoT objects are connected to the internet at affordable costs. Since the development of LoRa, many IoT applications have adopted LoRa and achieved success in the market. Currently, IoT technologies keep evolving towards different fields, giving rise to multifarious IoT applications including industrial IoT, smart city IoT, healthcare IoT, and direct-to-satellite IoT. In the meantime, LoRa also keeps developing and finding its position in various IoT applications either as a main or complementary player. The objective of this survey is to (1) provide a fundamental understanding of the LoRa technology; (2) explore research activities studying LoRa based communication systems for new IoT applications; and (3) demonstrate how the LoRa technology works together with other technologies to deliver better IoT services to end users.},

Towards that goal, Long Range (LoRa) is a promising physical layer technology which features low data-rates and large communication ranges, while requiring only low power. However, as the number of devices increases, more and more collisions occur, hence severely degrading LoRa system performances. To cope with this critical drawback, several LoRa collision decoding algorithms and MAC protocols have been proposed. The purpose of this article is to present how collision decoding algorithms interact with MAC layer protocols, and to discuss the potential of such integrated approaches. To do so, we first classify the collision decoding algorithms according to their principles and distinctive features, and compare some reference algorithms in a single simulation setup, using a Software Defined Radio hardware. Then, we analyze how each class of MAC protocols can benefit from each category of collision decoding algorithms. Finally, we discuss long-term perspectives and open issues in this active research area.},

	abstract = {Long-range (LoRa) technology is most widely used for enabling low-power wide area networks (WANs) on unlicensed frequency bands. Despite its modest data rates, it provides extensive coverage for low-power devices, making it an ideal communication system for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In general, LoRa is considered as the physical layer, whereas LoRaWAN is the medium access control (MAC) layer of the LoRa stack that adopts a star topology to enable communication between multiple end devices (EDs) and the network gateway. The chirp spread spectrum modulation deals with LoRa signal interference and ensures long-range communication. At the same time, the adaptive data rate mechanism allows EDs to dynamically alter some LoRa features, such as the spreading factor (SF), code rate, and carrier frequency to address the time variance of communication conditions in dense networks. Despite the high LoRa connectivity demand, LoRa signals interference and concurrent transmission collisions are major limitations. Therefore, to enhance LoRaWAN capacity, the LoRa Alliance released many LoRaWAN versions, and the research community has provided numerous solutions to develop scalable LoRaWAN technology. Hence, we thoroughly examine LoRaWAN scalability challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in both the physical and MAC layers. These solutions primarily rely on SF, logical, and frequency channel assignment, whereas others propose new network topologies or implement signal processing schemes to cancel the interference and allow LoRaWAN to connect more EDs efficiently. A summary of the existing solutions in the literature is provided at the end of the paper, describing the advantages and disadvantages of each solution and suggesting possible enhancements as future research directions.},
